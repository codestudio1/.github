# Hi there 👋
## Welcome to Codestudio One

My name is Kim and I run Codestudio One as a hobby project where I learn coding and webdesign.

Some sources I use for learning and testing are:

+ [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
+ [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
+ [Freecode Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
+ [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
+ [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
+ [Replit](https://replit.com/)

  Feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://www.codestudio.one)

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
